// click  "Set Color" button => change "brush" box color to input field value
// Use jQuery to select the element, and addEventListener to handle clicks

// same as above for  enter key press (from inside the input field)

// Create 20 divs of the "square" class and append them to the body (.append())

// click on each "square", it changes the color of that individual square to "green"
// Hint: add event listener while creating squares, or listen for events on the body element

// modify: changes to the color I set using my input instead of "green" every time.

// Modify the CSS so that the "square" class has a height and width of 10px and a margin of 0.
