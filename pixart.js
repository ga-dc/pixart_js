// Using JavaScript, create 20 divs of the "square" class and append them to the body.

// (3) 'i++' instructs HOW the iterator should increment with each iteration--> ++ means "go up by 1 each time" (opposite is '--' insofar as "syntactic sugar" goes)

// Add functionality so that when I click on each "square", it changes the color of that individual square to "green"

// Modify your code so that when I click on each "square", it changes to the color I set using my input instead of "green" every time.

// Modify your code so that you are creating 8000 divs instead of 20.
// Change the event that changes your box colors from 'click' to 'mouseover'     // we want to be able to hover to change the color-- not have to click.
