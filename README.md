###Commit 5

* Modify your code so that when I click on each "square", it changes to the color I set using my input instead of "green" every time.

###Commit 6

* Modify the CSS so that the "square" class has a height and width of 10px and a margin of 0.
* Modify your code so that you are creating 8000 divs instead of 20.
* Change the event that changes your box colors from 'click' to 'mouseover'
* Paint a picture!

## Bonus

* Add a color swatch. You should have 3 boxes with the most recent 3 colors used. When you click on each of those boxes, it should set the current brush color back to that color.
