sql is like schema

Ruby classes are called models

now can perform cRUD actions


I created a step by step process to help me better understand the process of using Active Record. If I am missing steps or something needs to be added please let me know to better understand AR.



1. Make a folder

2. Create SQL file to drop tables and create customized Tables with ID, attributes and methods

3. Touch Gemfile for necessary Ruby Gem installs

4. Create a main ruby file for connection to ActiveRecord base connection, and use "require" for gemfiles and "require_relative" for ruby class files in a relative path

5. Create Ruby files with Classes pointing to ActiveRecord base.

6. In terminal, Create Database

7. Run Schema file (sql file)

8. Run Ruby file

9. Now you can create new tables of information in the terminal
